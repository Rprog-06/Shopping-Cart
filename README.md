##  Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with React
- **State Management**: Context API for global state
- **Styling**: CSS Modules for component-scoped styles
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with Express.js

### Key Design Choices
1. **State Management**
   - Used React Context for global state to avoid prop drilling
   - Local state for component-specific data

2. **Performance**
   - Implemented React.memo for performance optimization
   - Code splitting for better load times

3. **Error Handling**
   - Centralized error handling in the backend
   - User-friendly error messages in the frontend

### Assumptions
1. The application is a single-vendor e-commerce platform
2. No user authentication is required (for MVP)
3. The cart is persisted in localStorage
4. All prices are in Rupees
